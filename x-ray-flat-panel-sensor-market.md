<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Flat Panel Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Type</li><li>Direct Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-Ray flat panel sensor market is categorized into two types: indirect type and direct type. The indirect type utilizes a scintillator screen to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then detected by a photosensitive array. This approach involves additional components and can reduce image quality. In contrast, the direct type directly detects X-ray photons using photosensitive materials, eliminating the need for a scintillator. This results in improved image quality and simpler system design. Both types serve different needs and have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p></p>
