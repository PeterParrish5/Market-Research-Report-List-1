<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracic Aortic Covered Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bifurcated Type</li><li>Straight Tube type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Thoracic Aortic Covered Stents market includes two main types: Bifurcated Type and Straight Tube Type. Bifurcated Type stents are specifically designed to treat an aneurysm or dissection in the aortic arch, as they have branches that extend towards the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery. On the other hand, Straight Tube Type stents are used to treat descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, where the stent graft is deployed in a straight tube shape, thus providing effective sealing and reinforcement to the weakened walls of the aorta.</p></p>
