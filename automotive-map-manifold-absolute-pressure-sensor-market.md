<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Sensor</li><li>Digital Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) Sensor market encompasses two main types: Analog Sensors and Digital Sensors. Analog sensors measure and provide continuous output in the form of signals that vary in voltage or current, reflecting the pressure levels in the engine manifold. On the other hand, digital sensors convert the pressure readings into binary signals, delivering discrete output values that can be easily interpreted by microprocessors. Both types serve the same purpose of measuring manifold pressure but differ in the way they communicate and process the data.</p></p>
