<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Injection Peptide Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous Injection</li><li>Subcutaneous Injection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Injection Peptide Drug market is classified into two types: Intravenous Injection and Subcutaneous Injection. Intravenous Injection refers to the direct delivery of the peptide drug into the veins, allowing for rapid and immediate absorption into the bloodstream. On the other hand, Subcutaneous Injection involves injecting the drug into the subcutaneous tissue, just below the skin. This method provides a slower and more sustained release of the drug over a longer period of time. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the therapy.</p></p>
