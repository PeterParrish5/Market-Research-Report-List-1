<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Embolectomy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aspiration Systems</li><li>Stent Retreival Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurovascular embolectomy devices are used in the treatment of stroke patients. Aspiration systems are a type of device that uses suction to remove blood clots from blocked brain arteries. These devices are inserted through a catheter and help restore blood flow to the brain. On the other hand, stent retrieval systems employ a mesh-like stent structure to trap and retrieve blood clots. They are also inserted through a catheter and offer an effective approach to restoring blood flow in stroke patients. These devices play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing the risk of disability.</p></p>
