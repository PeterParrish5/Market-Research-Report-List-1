<p><strong>The Triethanol Amine Lauryl Sulfate Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emulsifier</li><li>Surfactant</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Triethanolamine lauryl sulfate (TEALS) is widely used as an emulsifier in various industries. As an emulsifier, it helps in blending two immiscible substances, such as oil and water, by reducing the surface tension between them. Additionally, TEALS serves as a surfactant, enabling it to reduce the interfacial tension between two liquids or a liquid and a solid. This property makes it valuable in the formulation of personal care products, such as shampoos and detergents. Moreover, TEALS finds applications in other industries, such as pharmaceuticals and textiles, where it functions as a stabilizer and cleansing agent, respectively.</p></p>
