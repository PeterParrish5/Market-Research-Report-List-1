<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Replacement Implants (Knee prosthesis) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Bearing Implants</li><li>Mobile-Bearing Implants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Knee replacement implants, also known as knee prosthesis, are devices used to replace damaged or diseased knee joints. Fixed-bearing implants are the most common type and provide stability by fixing the implant to the bone. Mobile-bearing implants, on the other hand, allow some degree of rotation and movement between the implant and the bone. These implants offer increased mobility and potentially reduced wear on the implant components. Both types of implants aim to relieve pain, improve knee function, and enhance the patient's quality of life.</p></p>
