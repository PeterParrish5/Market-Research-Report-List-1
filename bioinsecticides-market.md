<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioinsecticides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bacillus Thuringiensis</li><li>Insect Viruses</li><li>Plant Extract</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bioinsecticides are eco-friendly alternatives to chemical insecticides, used to combat pests in agriculture. Bacillus thuringiensis, a type of soil bacteria, is widely used as a bioinsecticide. It produces proteins toxic to pests, but harmless to humans and beneficial insects. Insect viruses, such as nucleopolyhedroviruses, selectively infect and kill specific pests, reducing their populations. Plant extracts from neem, pyrethrum, and garlic are natural bioinsecticides that repel or kill pests. These different types offer diverse strategies for pest control, promoting sustainable farming practices and reducing environmental impact.</p></p>
