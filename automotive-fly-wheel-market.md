<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fly Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single mass flywheel</li><li>Dual mass flywheel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive flywheel market consists of two main types: single mass flywheel and dual mass flywheel. In single mass flywheels, there is only one heavy flywheel that connects the engine to the transmission. These flywheels are more durable, but they transfer more vibrations and noise. On the other hand, dual mass flywheels have two separate flywheels with a damping mechanism in between to reduce vibrations and noise. However, they are more complex and expensive to manufacture. Both types serve the purpose of storing rotational energy and aiding in smooth engine operation.</p></p>
