<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Tachometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Handheld tachometers refer to portable devices used to measure the rotational speed of an object. There are two types of handheld tachometers available in the market: non-contact and contact. Non-contact tachometers use optical or laser technology to measure the speed of rotating objects without physically touching them. These tachometers are ideal for applications where the rotating object is difficult to access or when contact may result in damage. On the other hand, contact tachometers require physical contact between the measuring device and the rotating object, typically using a probe or wheel. These tachometers are commonly used for precise measurements and in situations where non-contact methods may not provide accurate results.</p></p>
