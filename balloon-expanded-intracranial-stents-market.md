<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded intracranial stents are medical devices used to treat certain brain conditions. Open loop stents are stent systems that consist of a single stent loop, which helps support the narrowed blood vessels. They are often used in treating aneurysms or brain vessel malformations. Closed-loop stents, on the other hand, consist of multiple interlocking loops for increased stability and security. They provide better support for larger aneurysms or complex vessel geometries. Both types of stents aim to reestablish normal blood flow and prevent potentially life-threatening complications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The balloon-expanded intracranial stents market finds application in treating both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurs due to a blockage in a blood vessel supplying oxygen to the brain, while hemorrhagic stroke occurs due to bleeding in the brain. These stents are used to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels in the brain, restoring blood flow and preventing further damage. They play a crucial role in reducing the mortality and morbidity rates associated with stroke by providing effective treatment options for patients.</p></p>
