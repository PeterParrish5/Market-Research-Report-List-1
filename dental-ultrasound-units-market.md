<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Ultrasound Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetostrictive</li><li>Piezoelectric</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dental ultrasound units are widely used in dentistry for various purposes. There are two main types of ultrasound units: magnetostrictive and piezoelectric. Magnetostrictive ultrasound units use a metal stack that expands and contracts when an electrical current is applied to create ultrasonic vibrations. These units are effective for general scaling and root planing procedures. On the other hand, piezoelectric ultrasound units use a crystalline material that produces ultrasonic vibrations when an electrical charge is applied. These units are more versatile and suitable for a wider range of dental procedures such as implantology and periodontal surgeries.</p></p>
