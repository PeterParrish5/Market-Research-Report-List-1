<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Biological Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Attenuated Vaccines</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The veterinary biological vaccines market can be categorized into three types: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and others. Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened microbes that can multiply within the animal and stimulate an immune response without causing disease. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, consist of killed microbes or components of the microbe, which are incapable of causing infection but can still trigger an immune response. The "others" category includes subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and recombinant vaccines, which use specific parts or genes of the microbe to stimulate immunity.</p></p>
