<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transparent Photovoltaic (PV) Glass for Buildings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Transparent</li><li>Semi Transparent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fully transparent photovoltaic (PV) glass refers to glass panels that are completely see-through, allowing natural light to enter a building while also generating electricity from the sun's energy. These panels can be integrated into windows, skylights, or architectural facades without compromising visibility. On the other hand, semi-transparent PV glass partially allows light to pass through while also containing embedded solar cells to produce electricity. This type of glass is typically used in areas where a balance between natural light and energy generation is desired, such as in curtain walls or canopies.</p></p>
