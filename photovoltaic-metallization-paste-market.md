<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Metallization Paste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BSF Solar Cells</li><li>PERC Solar Cells</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photovoltaic metallization paste refers to a material applied on solar cells to enhance their energy conversion efficiency. There are two main types of market for this paste: BSF solar cells and PERC solar cells. BSF (Back Surface Field) solar cells use metal contacts on their rear surface to prevent recombination, while PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) solar cells have a dielectric passivation layer on the rear surface. Both types aim to maximize light absorption and minimize energy loss, but differ in their metallization strategies for improved solar cell performance.</p></p>
