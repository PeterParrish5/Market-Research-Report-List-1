<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Auto-transfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Pump Transfusion Device</li><li>Off-Pump Transfusion Device</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Cardiopulmonary Auto-transfusion System market comprises two main types of devices: On-Pump Transfusion Device and Off-Pump Transfusion Device. On-Pump Transfusion Devices are used during cardiac surgeries where a heart-lung machine is used to temporarily take over the heart and lung functions. These devices collect and filter the patient's own blood, eliminating the need for blood transfusions from external sources. In contrast, Off-Pump Transfusion Devices are utilized during surgeries performed on a beating heart, without the need for a heart-lung machine. These devices collect and return the patient's own blood during the procedure, reducing the reliance on external blood supplies.</p></p>
