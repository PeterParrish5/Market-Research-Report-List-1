<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Sense Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD Type</li><li>Through Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The current sense resistor market consists of two main types: SMD type and through-hole type. SMD type refers to surface mount device resistors that can be directly mounted onto the surface of a circuit board, enabling compact and efficient designs. On the other hand, through-hole type resistors have leads that are inserted into holes on the circuit board, ensuring a sturdy and reliable connection. Both types offer precise current measurement capabilities, but SMD type is more popular in modern electronic devices due to its smaller size and better suitability for automated assembly.</p></p>
