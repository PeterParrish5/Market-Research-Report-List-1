<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Anti-Corrosion Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Component Coatings</li><li>Multi-component Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based anti-corrosion coating market consists of two main types: Single Component Coatings and Multi-component Coatings. Single Component Coatings are ready-to-use coatings that require no mixing and can be directly applied to the surface. They provide convenience and simplicity but may have limitations in terms of performance. On the other hand, Multi-component Coatings are more complex as they require mixing of different components before application. These coatings offer improved performance characteristics, such as enhanced chemical resistance and durability, but involve more preparation and may be more costly.</p></p>
