<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotating Biological Contactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anaerobic Rotating Biological Contactors</li><li>Aerobic Rotating Biological Contactors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rotating Biological Contactors (RBCs) are wastewater treatment systems that utilize a series of rotating discs or media to support the growth of microorganisms that break down organic matter. There are two main types of RBCs: anaerobic and aerobic. Anaerobic RBCs operate without oxygen and are used for treating high-strength industrial wastewater or sludge. On the other hand, aerobic RBCs require oxygen and are commonly used for municipal wastewater treatment. Both types effectively remove pollutants, but their applications and operational requirements differ based on the type of wastewater being treated.</p></p>
