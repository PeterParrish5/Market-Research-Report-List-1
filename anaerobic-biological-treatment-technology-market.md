<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Biological Treatment Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anaerobic Biological Treatment Technology is a solution for treating organic waste without oxygen. It is classified into two main types: Batch Type and Continuous Type. Batch Type involves treating a limited volume of waste in a batch process, allowing for better control over the treatment. Continuous Type, on the other hand, treats waste continuously, making it more suitable for large-scale operations. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as waste volume, treatment efficiency, and cost considerations.</p></p>
