<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent-free Polyurethane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocomponent</li><li>Bi-component</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The solvent-free polyurethane market includes two major types: monocomponent and bi-component. Monocomponent polyurethane refers to a system where all the necessary ingredients are pre-mixed and stored in a single container. This type is easier to handle and exhibits a longer shelf life. On the other hand, bi-component polyurethane consists of two separate components that need to be mixed before application. This type offers more flexibility in terms of adjustability and curing time. Both options are popular and widely used in various industries for applications such as adhesives, coatings, and sealants.</p></p>
