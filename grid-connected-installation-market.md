<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grid-connected Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Battery</li><li>Without Battery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Grid-connected installations refer to solar power systems that are connected to the electrical grid. The market types can be categorized into two groups: with battery and without battery. With battery installations incorporate energy storage systems, enabling the stored solar energy to be used during peak demand or when the grid is down. Without battery installations lack energy storage capabilities, meaning excess energy is fed back to the grid for others to use or consumed in real-time. These market types offer different options depending on the need for energy storage and grid reliability.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Grid-connected Installation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Grid Connection</li><li>Distributed Grid Connection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the grid-connected installation market, there are two main applications: centralized grid connection and distributed grid connection. Centralized grid connection refers to large-scale power plants that are connected to the electricity grid in a centralized manner. These plants generate electricity on a large scale and supply it to the grid. In contrast, distributed grid connection involves multiple smaller-scale power generators, such as residential solar panels, connected to the grid in a decentralized manner. This allows for localized generation and distribution of electricity. Both applications aim to provide sustainable and reliable power supply to the grid.</p></p>
