<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Tension Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Surface Tension Meter</li><li>Dynamic Surface Tension Meter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface tension meters are devices used to measure the surface tension of liquids. There are two main types: static surface tension meters and dynamic surface tension meters. Static surface tension meters measure the force required to separate a ring or wire from a liquid surface, providing data on the liquid's cohesive forces. Dynamic surface tension meters, on the other hand, measure the time it takes for a liquid to rise or fall in a capillary, providing information on the liquid's adhesive forces. Both types of meters help in studying the behavior of liquids in various industries.</p></p>
