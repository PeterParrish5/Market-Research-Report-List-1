<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Room Hygrostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Double Stage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Room hygrostats are devices used to control the level of humidity in a room. There are two market types of room hygrostats: single-stage and double-stage. In the single-stage market, the hygrostat operates at a fixed humidity level and will either turn the humidifier on or off based on that threshold. On the other hand, in the double-stage market, the hygrostat has two humidity thresholds and can operate both humidifier and dehumidifier based on those thresholds. This allows for more precise control of the humidity levels in the room.</p></p>
